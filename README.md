# SPAM DETECTION SYSTEM
A spam detection system developed using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The system is designed to classify emails or text messages as either spam or legitimate (ham).
# Features
1. Utilizes the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library for text preprocessing, including tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming.
2. Implements a machine learning algorithm (e.g., Naive Bayes classifier) to classify messages based on their content.
3. Provides evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the performance of the spam detection system.
# NLTK Usage
The NLTK library is employed for various text preprocessing tasks:
1. Tokenization: Segmenting text into individual words or tokens.
2. Stopword Removal: Eliminating common words (e.g., "the", "is", "and") that do not carry significant meaning.
3. Stemming: Reducing words to their root form to improve consistency in text analysis.
